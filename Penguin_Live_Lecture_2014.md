FADING COIN The best coin trick that Eugene has learned in the past 15 years! Completely impromptu and it can be done anywhere in the world with any coins.

LIMITED EDITION Eugene’s presentation and handling for this modern classic where you break the rules and tell your audience exactly what you are going to do and then you do it.

GEMINI MONEY One of Eugene’s favorite pieces of magic for the times he worked behind a bar. Tensions rise leading to a happy conclusion for all.

OUT OF THIS WORLD Eugene’s direct handling and presentation for this classic effect where an audience member separates the red and black cards. Eugene begins with a borrowed and shuffled deck and uses clever strategies to create a mind boggling effect.

THE PACK THAT CUTS ITSELF Eugene uses this as his opening effect for corporate cocktail party work. You will learn the inner secrets of this amazing piece of card magic where the cards move by themselves and are immediately taken for examination by the audience member.

THE TURNING CARDS Under cover of a scarf, selected cards come out of the deck, turn over and reinsert themselves into the pack. Sometimes Eugene presents this as a piece of spirit magic.

SPIRIT MESSAGES Eugene presents three different close-up presentations and methods for the effect of spirit writing. All are regularly performed by Eugene and you will learn all the subtle touches to make this into a featured and talked about effect.
