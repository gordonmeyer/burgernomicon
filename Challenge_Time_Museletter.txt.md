# The Challenge of Time

"And this brings us to the subject of my essay. It is time. It is the ability to perform for the specific   time that has been allotted to us. Not to go over. Not to do more time than expected."

Also discussed is Eugene's relationship and work with Michael Carbonaro.

Referenced is Carbonaro's presentation for Shotglass Surprise, featured on the pilot for his show, "The Carbonaro Effect."
