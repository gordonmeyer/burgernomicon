# The After-Dinner Show for Friends Lecture

When invited to dinner, in a restaurant or in a friendâ€™ s home, amateur and professional magicians are very often asked to perform some magic.
 
Eugene will give examples of material he does for this kind of show. He will also discuss the psychology of performing free shows for friends and family as opposed to shows for paying clients.

First presented at "Conjuror's Corner" club. Mount Prospect, IL. June 23, 2014
