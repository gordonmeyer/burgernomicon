# Eugene's Notebook: Performing Magic Socially

April 2015 Genii Magazine. Page 15

Eugene and Jeff McBride discuss performing magic for friends and family. 

"...our family and friends often try to keep us in the little boxes they have created around us. They imagine who we are and don't want to see us move out of that picture, that little box into which we haven't put.â€¦ I don't think we should simply blame our family and friends because there are things we can do. First of all, we need to understand that the problem is simply them; the problem, in part, is also us!"
